# 🤖 Gradio: Building Generative AI Apps

In this repo, we'll build an Image Generation app, an Image Captioning app, and a Text Summarization App. Then, we'll deploy them on Hugging Face Spaces.

# ⚙️The Build Process (Deliverables)

### Build 🏗️
* **Text Summarization App:** to take input text, summarize it with an open-source large language model, and display the summary
* **Image Captioning App:** allows the user to upload an image, which uses an image to text (image captioning) to describe the uploaded image, and display both the image and the caption in the app.
* **Image Generation App:** takes text and generates an image with a diffusion model, then displays the generated image within the app
* Create an interface to chat with an open source LLM using **Falcon**, the best-ranking open source LLM on the Open LLM Leaderboard.
